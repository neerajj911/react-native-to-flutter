# React Native → Flutter SDK

Minimal SDK that lets a React Native app open an embedded Flutter screen and pass it static data over a `MethodChannel`. Engine is cached, so the first `open()` warms it up and every subsequent one is instant.

## Architecture flow

```
React Native app
        │  MySDK.open({ userName, userId })
        ▼
packages/react_native_sdk/src/index.ts
        ▼
MySDKModule.kt
        │  ensureEngine() — create + cache FlutterEngine on first call
        │  startActivity(Intent → FlutterScreenActivity, extras=data)
        ▼
FlutterScreenActivity
        │  provideFlutterEngine() returns the cached engine
        │  MethodChannel('sdk_channel')
        │  on 'ready' from Flutter → invokeMethod('setUser', extras)
        ▼
DashboardScreen (Dart)
        Hello Nanu
        User ID: 123
```

## Components

- **Flutter module (`packages/flutter_sdk/`)** — the UI. One screen, one channel.
- **RN wrapper (`packages/react_native_sdk/src/index.ts`)** — the JS surface, a single `open(data)` method.
- **Android bridge (`packages/react_native_sdk/android/`)** — Kotlin module that warms/caches the engine and launches the Flutter activity.
- **MethodChannel `sdk_channel`** — the only path data takes into Dart. No `initialRoute`, no intent reads from Dart.

## Why the ready-handshake

1. `DashboardScreen` registers its handler on `sdk_channel`, then calls `ready`.
2. `FlutterScreenActivity` receives `ready`, replies with `invokeMethod('setUser', extras)`.
3. Dart receives `setUser`, updates state.

This kills the race where Android could push data before Dart was listening.

## Why a cached engine

Without caching, every `open()` starts a fresh `FlutterEngine` (~300–800ms cold start). We cache it once in `FlutterEngineCache` under the id `"sdk_engine"`. The first `open()` pays the cost; every later `open()` is instant.

## First-time setup

The repo ships only hand-written source. Run the bootstrap once to generate the platform skeletons (`flutter create --template module` and `npx react-native init`), patch the example app's gradle + `MainApplication`, and do a first build:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

It's idempotent — re-running skips steps that are already done.

## Local build (after bootstrap)

```bash
./scripts/build-local.sh    # rebuild AAR + wrapper after SDK changes
cd example && npm run android
```

`build-local.sh` runs `flutter build aar`, copies the repo into `packages/react_native_sdk/android/flutter_aar/`, then `npm install && npm run build` on the wrapper.

## How the AAR gets to consumers (not just locally)

The wrapper's gradle file ([android/build.gradle](packages/react_native_sdk/android/build.gradle)) has an `ensureFlutterAar` task that runs before `preBuild`. It resolves the AAR in this order:

1. **Already staged** — `android/flutter_aar/` is populated. No-op. (This is what release-tarball consumers see.)
2. **Sibling module present** — runs `flutter build aar` in `../../flutter_sdk` and copies the output. (This is the monorepo dev case, or anyone who installs the wrapper next to the flutter module.)
3. **Neither** — fails with a clear error.

The release workflow stages step 1 into the published tarball, so end users never hit step 2 unless they want to.

## Troubleshooting

**`Unable to establish loopback connection` during `flutter build aar` on Windows** — known Gradle 8.14 + Windows + JDK issue (`UnixDomainSockets.connect0` fails). Workarounds: add an antivirus exclusion for the project + `~/.gradle`, or pin Gradle down in `packages/flutter_sdk/.android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` (`gradle-8.7-all.zip`). CI (Linux) is unaffected.

## GitHub Actions

Three workflows, all triggered on `v*` tag push (only `release.yml` runs end-to-end; the other two are reusable via `workflow_call`):

- `flutter-build.yml` — `flutter build aar` → uploads the Maven repo as an artifact.
- `sdk-package.yml` — builds the JS wrapper → uploads `lib/` and Android sources.
- `release.yml` — validates versions, calls both builds, downloads artifacts, packs a tarball, creates a GitHub Release.

No npm publish yet. The tarball is attached to the release; promote to npm manually once you trust the pipeline.

If a build fails, re-run only the failed job — artifacts from the other are reused.

## Versioning

Semantic. Three places must agree before a release ships:

- git tag (e.g. `v1.0.1`)
- `packages/react_native_sdk/package.json` `version`
- `packages/flutter_sdk/pubspec.yaml` `version`

`scripts/check-versions.sh` enforces this locally and in CI (the `validate` job in `release.yml`).

```bash
# bump both files to 1.0.1, commit, then:
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin main --tags
```

## Client integration

```javascript
import MySDK from "rn-flutter-sdk";

MySDK.open({
  userName: "Nanu",
  userId: "123"
});
```

The `open()` payload is an object, so extra keys (`theme`, `language`, …) can be added later without breaking existing callers.

### One-time Android host setup

1. **Add two Maven repos** to your app's `android/build.gradle` `allprojects.repositories` block:
   ```gradle
   allprojects {
       repositories {
           google()
           mavenCentral()
           // Flutter engine binaries (Google-hosted, required because the AAR has transitive deps on them)
           maven { url 'https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io' }
           // Our wrapper's AAR
           maven { url 'https://neerajj911.github.io/react-native-to-flutter/maven' }
       }
   }
   ```
2. **Package registration is automatic** via RN autolinking (RN 0.60+). Do **not** add `MySDKPackage()` to `getPackages()` manually — that causes a "tried to override MySDKModule" runtime error.
3. **Bump SDK versions in `android/build.gradle`** to match Flutter's requirements:
   ```gradle
   ext {
       minSdkVersion = 24      // Flutter requires >= 24
       compileSdkVersion = 36  // Flutter 3.38+ requires >= 36
       targetSdkVersion = 36
   }
   ```
4. **Suppress the AGP compileSdk warning** by adding this to `android/gradle.properties`:
   ```properties
   android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=36
   ```
   (RN 0.74 ships AGP 8.2.1, which warns about compileSdk > 34 but compiles fine.)
